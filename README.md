# Audit-Firm-Risk-Analysis

## **Audit Firm Risk Analysis Using Machine Learning**  

### **Project Overview**  
This project aims to analyze risk factors in audit firms using **data science and machine learning**. The objective is to identify patterns in financial data and predict the risk level of firms.  

### **Data Processing**  
The dataset was loaded and explored to understand its structure. Missing values in the **Money_Value** column were replaced with a default value to ensure consistency.  

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
Various **data visualization techniques** were used to analyze distributions and relationships between variables. **Distribution plots** helped in understanding the spread of data, while a **correlation heatmap** provided insights into variable dependencies. **Count plots** were used to visualize categorical distributions like **LOSS_SCORE** and **District**.  

### **Machine Learning Model**  
The data was split into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** to train different **classification models**. Models such as **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN** were applied. The **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the highest accuracy of **98%**.  

### **Conclusion**  
The project successfully identified risk factors in audit firms. Using **machine learning for risk prediction**, businesses can improve **fraud detection** and **financial risk management**, leading to more informed decision-making.
